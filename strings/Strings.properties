gameDesc = &emsp;Mana Spark is about humanity being the weak minority.<br>You are a human constantly fighting at a disadvantage. There are traps along the way, the enemies work together to kill you, and all you have to rely on are your trusty bow and dodging skills. While other races live in prosperous societies fueled by mana, humans have been subjugated, massacred, and enslaved. Humans' lack of mana energy in their bodies left the race exposed to the power of magic without the ability to defend themselves, leading to abuses like the recent outbreak of mysterious kidnappings.<br>We have no heroes to save us, but that doesn't mean we're not going to fight back.<br>
gameFeatures = <br>A challenging action RPG/Roguelike with deep combat and enemies that can collaborate between themselves to kill you.
poem = <br>"Tonight we stand together<br>Together we defy the dark<br>The days to come are better<br>We just need a mana spark"<br><br>
